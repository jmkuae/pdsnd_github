## Project Description

Project using Python to explore data related to bike share data provided by Motivate.

The project has 1 dataset from 3 cities - Chicago, New York City and Washington. CSV files not on this project.

The code imports the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. 

## Filters

The questions are based on each city data, so the first question is which city to analyse.

After, implemented 2 tipes of filters:
* Filter by any specific Month
* Filter by day of the week

## Data used
